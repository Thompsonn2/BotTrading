# Learning Objectives for Web Development

- **Using Version Control Systems**:
  - A learner will use the GitHub version control system in the following
    fashion:
    - Clone a GitHub repository without error using either a terminal window or
      an extension for Git integration in a text editor like VS Code.
    - Write short and descriptive commit messages that explain the specific way
      in which a commit changes the source code and documentation in the GitHub
      repository.
    - Use GitHub pre-commit hooks to ensure that all of the source code,
      technical writing, and commit messages adhere to the industry standards
      for content and format.
    - Navigate reports produced by GitHub Actions so as to determine which
      aspects of a GitHub repository do not adhere to a project's specification.
    - Use the GitHub Flow model to implement specific features in a branch of a
      GitHub repository and then merge that branch to the main one only after
      all the checks run by GitHub Actions pass as required.
    - Create and discuss programming and technical writing issues through the
      use of the GitHub issue tracker, furnishing descriptive issue titles and
      descriptions that adhere to industry best practices.
    - Submit completed projects that pass all of the instructor-provided and
      industry-standard checks, as evidenced through the report of a passing
      build by GitHub Actions.

- Performing Web Development:
  - A learner will implement a finished web site that:
    - Consists of between one and five hundred lines of source code that is
      logically organized into separate components that each feature all the
      aforementioned characteristics.
    - Uses the most appropriate web development technology in order to achieve
      the desired layout and display all the site's content.
    - Features content consisting of text, audio, and video that adheres to a
      consistent theme.
    - Correctly displays the site's content on a wide variety of devices,
      including, but not limited to, laptops, desktops, tablets, and mobile
      phones.
    - Takes into account user preferences and demographics, thereby ensuring
      that it is both accessible and in adherence to both the cultural
      expectations and legal and ethical frameworks of the intended audience.
    - Features external documentation that uses precise technical writing to
      defend the validity of the design, implementation, and testing decisions
      that the learner made when creating the web site.
  - A learner will create a component in Markdown, HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript
    that contains up to one-hundred lines of source code and has the following
    characteristics:
    - Has variable names that adhere to an industry-standard coding style.
    - Has descriptive comments for both the component declaration and the
      component's code that adhere to an industry-standard coding style.
    - Features a source code format that adheres to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Passes either a manual or an automated test suite, thereby demonstrating
      that it furnishes a correct implementation of the component's
      specification.
    - Performs the specified operations in an efficient fashion, as determined
      through experiments that evaluate the component's performance.
    - Correctly uses assignment statements, iteration constructs, conditional
      logic, recursion, and other features of the chosen web development
      language in a way that passes the test suite, works efficiently, and
      conveys the intended purpose of the component.
    - Uses precise written content to defend the validity of the design,
      implementation, and testing decisions that the learner made when creating
      the web component.


- **Using Web Development Tools:
  - A learner will use a web development environment to complete these tasks
    while implementing a web site consisting of between one and five hundred
      lines of code:
    - Install, upgrade, and use the programs needed for developing web sites
      that consist of Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Use Docker to run, in an isolated container and without error, either a
      component of a web site or a web development tool.
    - Use Docker to run, in an isolated container and without error, both a test
      suite and autograding tools.
    - Use testing to detect a failure in a web site and then effectively use
      tools like a text editor, a terminal window, and a web browser to find and
      fix the failure, ultimately confirming that the web site no longer
      contains the failure and that the fix did not compromise other components
      of the web site.
    - Use a text editor to participate in remote web development by effectively
      completing the following tasks:
      - Creating and accepting an invitation to collaboratively implement a web
        site.
      - Collaboratively sharing a terminal window with a remote developer.
      - Running a web server and then sharing the access to that server with a
        remote developer.
